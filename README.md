# traffic-sign-recognition
This notebook contains my submission to the German Traffic Sign Kaggle competition, which achieved a private test accuracy of over 99%. My model consists of a deep convolutional neural network written in Pytorch. Other performance enhancing features include the use of Nesterov momentum, data augmentation, and a dynamic learning rate.
